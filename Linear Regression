%This MATLAB program removes anomalies from a data set before doing linear regression on the resulting data. Any anomalous or extreme data points that are
%distant from the distribution's mean are eliminated in the first step of the code. The linear regression is computed using the remaining data points after 
%these outliers have been removed. A line of best fit illustrating the relationship between the variables is provided as the output of this regression.
%The code then uses the filtered data and the linear regression function to compute a value. Based on a specific value of the predictor variable,
%this value represents the response variable's predicted value. Overall, this MATLAB method is helpful for getting precise and reliable findings from data sets
%that may contain unwanted outliers.

function [fX, fY, slope, intercept, Rsquared] = linearRegression(x,y)
%linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set
%   Compute the linear regression based on inputs:
%     1. x: x-values for our data set
%     2. y: y-values for our data set
if size(x) ~= size(y)
        error('x and y have different size')
end    
n1 = length(x)
[sortedY, sortOrder] = sort(y);
sortedX = x(sortOrder);
% Calculate Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3
Q = quantile(sortedY, [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]);
Q1 = Q(1);
Q3 = Q(3);

IQR = Q3-Q1;
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR;
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR;
outliers = sortedY < lower_bound | sortedY > upper_bound;

% Remove any data points that fall outside the bounds
cleaned_Y = sortedY(~outliers)
cleaned_X = sortedX(~outliers)
%   Outputs:
%     1. fX: x-values with outliers removed
%     2. fY: y-values with outliers removed

fX = cleaned_X;
fY = cleaned_Y;
n = length(fX);
sxy = sum(fX.*fY);
sx = sum(fX);
sy = sum(fY);
sx2 = sum(fX.^2);
sy2 = sum(fY.^2);
%     3. slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
slope = ((n*sxy-sx*sy))/(n*sx2-sx^2);
%     4. intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
intercept = mean(fY)-slope.*mean(fX)
%     5. Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
St = sum((fY-mean(fY)).^2);
Sr = sum((fY-intercept-slope.*fX).^2);
Rsquared = 1- (Sr/St);
