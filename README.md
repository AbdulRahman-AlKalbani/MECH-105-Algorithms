# MECH-105-Algorithms
This folder contains a diverse set of algorithms that I developed as a student. The False Position root finding method is a numerical technique used to approximate 
the roots of a function. The LU Factorization with partial pivoting is a matrix decomposition method used to solve systems of linear equations. Linear Regression is
a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables. And Simpsons Integration is a numerical method used to approximate the area under a 
curve. Each of these algorithms represents a unique and valuable contribution to the field of computer science and mathematics. I am excited to share these algorithms
with others and hope they will inspire further innovation and exploration in the field.
